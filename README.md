# My Web Development Journey

This repository showcases some of the projects and exercises I completed during the "Tvorba www aplikac√≠" course.

## About the Course

The "Tvorba www aplikac√≠" course was a very intensive 3-month program focused on building web applications. It covered the following key technologies:

* **HTML:** The fundamental building blocks of web pages.
* **CSS:** Styling web pages to make them visually appealing and responsive.
* **PHP:** A server-side scripting language for dynamic web content.
* **JavaScript:** A client-side scripting language for interactive web elements.

This course provided me with a solid foundation in front-end and back-end web development.

## What to Expect in this Repository
